today we got to know a new platform which is Heroku. 

It is a platform tailored to developers who want to byild their applications and

 depolying them directly on the cloud without considering the stuff like which
 
  server they wnated to deploy their work on and the hardware stuff. So the developer will be able to focus on his work insttead of foucusing on the technical stuff.

  but first we nedd to download Node.js following some installation steps and you need to create an account on Heroku to be able to use it.
